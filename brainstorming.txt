1) See if the messages need to be fed to the gaussian node in order
   rearrange the demonstration points

2) See the order of the dataset as there is one data shifted in each demonstration

"learned-traj-peginhole-D1-3gaus.bag":
-this one works good with good Peg insertion
-3 Demonstrations


TOTRY: before implementing DTW
- increase no. of gaussians (it didn't make a diff in D5)
- increase no. of steps in MoveTrajectory func (it didn't make a diff in D5)
- increase the stiffness (it made a diff in D1; since the robot is learned on positions; it is better to increase the stiffness of positions and decrease of orientations)
- increase the linear velocity (it didn't make a diff in D5)
- make sure the end-effector orientation is vertical
- restarting the robot (didn't make a diff in D1)
- keeping all demons almost similar


TODO:
- create a separate node for DTW and publish the modified demons on gmm/data  $ DONE $


NOTE:
-- Added the 0.01 in position.z, stiffness = (3500, 3500, 3500, 300, 300, 300):
- learned-traj-peginhole-D8-3gauss works perfect.
- learned-traj-peginhole-D8-3gauss works perfect.
- learned-traj-peginhole-D8-4gauss works only when the peg is strictly aligned with the Hole. (even when I set the stiffness to max -> (5000, 5000, 5000, 300, 300, 300))

TOTRY: after implementing DTW
- take the shortest demons instead of the longest one as the reference demon.
- increase the number of demons.
- filter out the different demons together and keep the similar one (according to dtw_distance)


LfD data collection description:
- no. of gaussians
- cartesian velocity - Impedance (stiffness, damping)

TODO: ONLINE Learning
- create the rosbag for recording the trials in IiwaRobot::Demonstration [DONE]
- start the DATA_ACQ node after the FINISH_COMMAND_IIWA if there is a new demons file added from last trial.
- Inside DATA_ACQ node, there should be a function to append the newly added demons to the big D.bag demons file.

ERROR "One or more robots are not in the planned path" in the teach pendant
TOTRY:
- change the threads in the AsyncSpinner
- make sure the haptic device is calibrated each trial
