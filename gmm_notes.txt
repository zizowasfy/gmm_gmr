** Sampling over the Euclidean distance (sqrt(...))
- if given a point not in the training data (demons), the GMR cannot regress 
and/or perfrom arbitrarly -- generates poses in the opposite direction (??!! not 
in the opposite direction, it just regresses outside the gaussians of the GMM)


** Sample over each axis (xyz) separately 

TODO:
- Clean the code
- Display info about the learned GMM/trajectory (in a topic and/or service)
- Visualize the GMM in RViz
- Visualize the learned trajectory in RViz
- Save the learned trajectory
- Save the GMM in a file
