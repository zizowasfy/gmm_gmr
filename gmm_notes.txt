** Sampling over the Euclidean distance (sqrt(...))
- if given a point not in the training data (demons), the GMR cannot regress 
and/or perfrom arbitrarly -- generates poses in the opposite direction (??!! not 
in the opposite direction, it just regresses outside the gaussians of the GMM)


** Sample over each axis (xyz) separately
